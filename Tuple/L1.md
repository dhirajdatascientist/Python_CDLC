## Tuples in Python (L1)

1. **What is a tuple in Python?**
   - A tuple in Python is an ordered and immutable collection of elements. Like lists, tuples can contain various data types, including numbers, strings, and other tuples. Tuples are created using parentheses, and elements are separated by commas.

2. **How to create a tuple?**
   - You can create a tuple in Python by enclosing elements within parentheses:
     ```python
     my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 'apple', 'banana')
     ```

3. **Accessing elements in a tuple:**
   - Elements in a tuple are indexed, starting from 0. You can access elements using square brackets and the index, just like with lists:
     ```python
     first_element = my_tuple[0]  # Retrieves the first element (1)
     ```

4. **Tuple immutability:**
   - Unlike lists, tuples are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed once defined. You cannot add, remove, or modify elements in a tuple.

5. **Tuple packing and unpacking:**
   - Tuple packing is the process of creating a tuple by placing multiple values inside parentheses. Tuple unpacking allows you to assign the elements of a tuple to variables:
     ```python
     my_tuple = 1, 2, 3  # Tuple packing
     x, y, z = my_tuple  # Tuple unpacking
     ```

6. **Common tuple operations:**
   - Tuples support operations like concatenation (`+`), repetition (`*`), and length determination (`len()`).

7. **Iterating through a tuple:**
   - You can use loops (e.g., `for` loop) to iterate through the elements of a tuple:
     ```python
     for item in my_tuple:
         print(item)
     ```

8. **Advantages of tuples:**
   - Tuples are useful when you want to store a collection of elements that should not be modified, such as coordinates or configuration settings.

9. **When to use tuples vs. lists:**
   - Use tuples when you need an immutable collection of elements.
   - Use lists when you need a mutable collection and plan to modify, add, or remove elements.

10. **Nested tuples:**
    - Tuples can contain other tuples, allowing for nested data structures:
      ```python
      nested_tuple = ((1, 2), ('a', 'b'))
      ```
