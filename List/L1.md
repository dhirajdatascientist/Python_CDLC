## Lists in Python (L1)

1. **What is a list in Python?**
   - A list in Python is a collection of ordered and mutable elements. It can contain various data types, including numbers, strings, and even other lists. Lists are created using square brackets, and elements are separated by commas.

2. **How to create a list?**
   - You can create a list in Python by enclosing elements within square brackets:
     ```python
     my_list = [1, 2, 3, 'apple', 'banana']
     ```

3. **Accessing elements in a list:**
   - Elements in a list are indexed, starting from 0. You can access elements using square brackets and the index:
     ```python
     first_element = my_list[0]  # Retrieves the first element (1)
     ```

4. **Modifying a list:**
   - Lists are mutable, which means you can change their contents. You can assign new values to specific elements:
     ```python
     my_list[3] = 'cherry'  # Changes 'apple' to 'cherry'
     ```

5. **Adding elements to a list:**
   - You can add elements to the end of a list using the `append()` method:
     ```python
     my_list.append(4)  # Adds 4 to the end of the list
     ```

6. **Removing elements from a list:**
   - To remove an element by its value, you can use the `remove()` method:
     ```python
     my_list.remove('banana')  # Removes 'banana' from the list
     ```
   - To remove an element by its index, you can use the `pop()` method:
     ```python
     my_list.pop(2)  # Removes the element at index 2 (3)
     ```

7. **List slicing:**
   - You can extract a portion of a list using slicing. It involves specifying a start and end index:
     ```python
     sliced_list = my_list[1:4]  # Creates a new list from index 1 (inclusive) to 4 (exclusive)
     ```

8. **Common list operations:**
   - Lists support various operations, including concatenation (`+`), repetition (`*`), and length determination (`len()`).

9. **Iterating through a list:**
   - You can use loops (e.g., `for` loop) to iterate through the elements of a list:
     ```python
     for item in my_list:
         print(item)
     ```

10. **List comprehension:**
    - List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists based on existing lists or other iterable objects:
      ```python
      squares = [x ** 2 for x in my_list]
      ```
