## Sets in Python (L1)

1. **What is a set in Python?**
   - A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are created using curly braces `{}` or the `set()` constructor. They are often used for storing distinct values and performing set operations like union, intersection, and difference.

2. **How to create a set?**
   - You can create a set in Python by enclosing elements within curly braces or by using the `set()` constructor:
     ```python
     my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 4}  # Creates a set with unique elements (1, 2, 3, 4)
     ```

3. **Adding elements to a set:**
   - You can add elements to a set using the `add()` method:
     ```python
     my_set.add(5)  # Adds the element 5 to the set
     ```

4. **Removing elements from a set:**
   - To remove an element from a set, you can use the `remove()` method. If the element doesn't exist, it raises a `KeyError`. To avoid the error, you can use `discard()`:
     ```python
     my_set.remove(3)  # Removes the element 3
     my_set.discard(6)  # Removes the element 6 (if it exists)
     ```

5. **Set operations:**
   - Sets support various set operations, including union (`|`), intersection (`&`), difference (`-`), and symmetric difference (`^`).

6. **Checking membership:**
   - You can check if an element is present in a set using the `in` keyword:
     ```python
     is_present = 2 in my_set  # Checks if 2 is in the set
     ```

7. **Iterating through a set:**
   - You can use loops (e.g., `for` loop) to iterate through the elements of a set:
     ```python
     for item in my_set:
         print(item)
     ```

8. **Set comprehension:**
   - Set comprehensions provide a concise way to create sets based on existing sets or other iterable objects:
     ```python
     squares = {x ** 2 for x in my_set}
     ```

9. **Common use cases for sets:**
   - Sets are often used when you need to store unique values and perform operations like finding intersections between sets or removing duplicates from a list.

10. **Frozen sets:**
    - A frozen set is an immutable version of a set. Once created, its elements cannot be changed. You can create a frozen set using the `frozenset()` constructor:
      ```python
      my_frozen_set = frozenset([1, 2, 3])
      ```
