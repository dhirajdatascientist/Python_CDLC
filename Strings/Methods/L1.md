## String Methods in Python (SM1)

1. **What are string methods in Python?**
   - String methods are built-in functions in Python that allow you to perform various operations and manipulations on strings.

2. **`upper()`:**
   - The `upper()` method converts all characters in a string to uppercase.
     ```python
     text = "hello, world"
     upper_text = text.upper()  # Converts to "HELLO, WORLD"
     ```

3. **`lower()`:**
   - The `lower()` method converts all characters in a string to lowercase.
     ```python
     text = "Hello, World"
     lower_text = text.lower()  # Converts to "hello, world"
     ```

4. **`strip()`:**
   - The `strip()` method removes leading and trailing whitespace (including spaces, tabs, and newline characters) from a string.
     ```python
     text = "   Python   "
     stripped_text = text.strip()  # Removes leading/trailing spaces
     ```

5. **`replace()`:**
   - The `replace()` method replaces occurrences of a substring with another substring within a string.
     ```python
     text = "I like apples"
     new_text = text.replace("apples", "bananas")  # Replaces "apples" with "bananas"
     ```

6. **`split()`:**
   - The `split()` method splits a string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter (default is space).
     ```python
     sentence = "Hello, world!"
     words = sentence.split(", ")  # Splits at the comma and space
     ```

7. **`join()`:**
   - The `join()` method joins a list of strings into a single string using the specified delimiter.
     ```python
     words = ["Hello", "world!"]
     sentence = ", ".join(words)  # Joins with a comma and space
     ```

8. **`startswith()` and `endswith()`:**
   - `startswith()` checks if a string starts with a specified prefix.
   - `endswith()` checks if a string ends with a specified suffix.
     ```python
     text = "Hello, world"
     starts_with_hello = text.startswith("Hello")  # True
     ends_with_world = text.endswith("world")  # True
     ```

9. **`find()` and `index()`:**
   - `find()` and `index()` methods search for a substring within a string and return its position (index).
   - `find()` returns -1 if the substring is not found, while `index()` raises a `ValueError`.
     ```python
     text = "Python is great"
     position = text.find("is")  # Returns the index of "is" (7)
     ```

10. **`count()`:**
    - The `count()` method counts the number of occurrences of a substring within a string.
      ```python
      text = "Python programming is fun, and Python is versatile"
      count_python = text.count("Python")  # Counts occurrences of "Python" (2)
      ```

These notes cover some of the commonly used string methods in Python, which are helpful for manipulating and working with text data in your Python programs.
