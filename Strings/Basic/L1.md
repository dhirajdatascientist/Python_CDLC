## Basic String Operations in Python (SO1)

1. **What are basic string operations in Python?**
   - Basic string operations in Python refer to common tasks and manipulations you can perform on strings, which are sequences of characters.

2. **How do you create a string in Python?**
   - You can create a string in Python by enclosing characters in either single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes.
     ```python
     my_string = "Hello, Python!"
     ```

3. **Concatenation:**
   - Concatenation is the process of combining two or more strings into a single string using the `+` operator:
     ```python
     first_name = "John"
     last_name = "Doe"
     full_name = first_name + " " + last_name  # Combines first and last names
     ```

4. **String length:**
   - You can find the length of a string using the `len()` function:
     ```python
     text = "Hello, World!"
     length = len(text)  # Returns the length of the string (13)
     ```

5. **String slicing:**
   - String slicing allows you to extract a portion of a string by specifying start and end indices. Indexing starts at 0.
     ```python
     text = "Python Programming"
     substring = text[0:6]  # Extracts "Python"
     ```

6. **String methods:**
   - Python provides many built-in string methods for various operations, such as:
     - `lower()`: Converts the string to lowercase.
     - `upper()`: Converts the string to uppercase.
     - `strip()`: Removes leading and trailing whitespace.
     - `replace()`: Replaces a substring with another substring.
     - `split()`: Splits the string into a list of substrings based on a delimiter.
     - `join()`: Joins a list of strings into a single string using a specified delimiter.

7. **String formatting:**
   - String formatting allows you to insert variables or expressions into a string. You can use the `%` operator or f-strings (formatted strings) with `{}` placeholders.
     ```python
     name = "Alice"
     age = 30
     greeting = "Hello, %s! You are %d years old." % (name, age)
     ```

8. **Checking for substrings:**
   - You can check if a substring exists within a string using the `in` keyword:
     ```python
     text = "Python is fun"
     is_present = "is" in text  # Checks if "is" is in the string
     ```

9. **String interpolation (f-strings):**
   - F-strings (formatted strings) allow you to embed expressions and variables directly within strings, making string formatting more concise and readable:
     ```python
     name = "Bob"
     age = 25
     greeting = f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old."
     ```

10. **String immutability:**
    - Strings in Python are immutable, meaning their content cannot be changed once created. To modify a string, you create a new one based on the existing string.
